		<h1>CS446 Homework 1</h1>
		<h1>Problem 1A</h1>
		<p>Create a style sheet teststyle.css that will result in the pages shown below for the test files CSSDoc1.html:</p>
		<img src="hw1-example-01.jpg"/>
		<p>And CSSDoc2.html:</p>
		<img src="hw1-example-02.jpg"/>

		<h1>Problem 1B</h1>
		<p>Create a file circles.html that draws filled circles with SVG that are similar to the circles scaled with radii
			4, 3, 3, 5, 1, 6 as shown in lecture. Use a black rectangle as background. The distribution of the circles and their
			sizes should be as below, but the exact size of the rectangle and exact locations do not have to be the same.
			Include stroke outlined characters with your initials (my initials are HR) in the lower right hand corner of the
			diagram. You do not have to read in a file, all of the positions and radii can be hard-code in the file.</p>

		<h1>Problem 1C</h1>
		<p>We will use JavaScript to create some SVG code to display a very small dataset. The goal is to use some of the
			basics of JavaScript. The scenario is that three people (Alice, Bob and Carol) each have some savings to invest,
			and the names of two things they want to buy. This information is in the array people. The current cost of the
			things they want is stored in things. They will invest their savings at a rate of return (given in an interactive
			prompt) and the cost of the things they want to buy will increase at the rate of inflation (given in another
			interactive prompt.) This visualization will show each personâ€™s savings and the total cost of what they want to
			buy now, and the same quantities in 5 years, assuming annual compounding. You are given starter code
			SavingsPurchase-starter.html that builds up a web display of the current savings.</p>

		<h1>Problem 2</h1>
		<p>The Yale Office of Institutional Research makes a lot of data available
			<a href="https://oir.yale.edu/historical-data-main-page">here</a>. They include some
			<a href="https://oir.yale.edu/sites/default/files/w005_enroll_sum_fig_0.pdf">visualizations</a> which show
			enrollment trends, and the impact of WWII. Dataset w034 shows yale college registrations by department. Form two
			questions that can be examined with the data from w034 (e.g. looking at the composition of course registrations
			in a division, the change of the different divisions registrations over time, or something more imaginative).
			Using any method you want (any application like Excel, Mat Lab etc. or by hand) pick out data from w034 and
			visualize it to address the question. For each of the two questions: (1) Present a visualization and the data
			selected to make it. (2) Explain how the numbers in the selected data were transformed into visual elements
			(e.g. positions, sizes, colors etc). (3) Why is the style of visualization (i.e. pie chart, bar chart, scatter
			plot etc) best for answering this question?</p>
